**Start by cleaning our data:**

- Check and handle NaN values from DataFrame
- Completing empty values 
- Rename first column 
- Delete/Insert columns
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

**Once i have cleaned up the data a bit,then moved to the data exploration section. In this section i explored 3 high level business questions related to the data:**

- What is the trend of the real estate market in Tel Aviv?- What city sold the most product?
- What are the features that most influence the price of the apartment?
- Given a certain area of land in Tel Aviv - what is the effective combination in terms of planning and construction (floor, yard, roof, parking) to maximize the price of the property?

**To answer these questions i used in different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:**

- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the Correlation matrix
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Combined Plot bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Using scatter plots & legend for multiply Columns
-
